# HeraclitusBot

A bot tweeting random fragments from the [Heraclitus-Fragments](https://github.com/r03ert0/Heraclitus-Fragments) repository.

A fragment number is randomly selected from 1 to 129,
the greek and english versions of the fragment are
downloaded from [Heraclitus-Fragments](https://github.com/r03ert0/Heraclitus-Fragments),
the layout of the tweet is done using HTML,
then rendered as a `.png` file,
and finally sent to Twitter.

### How to contribute
What would be nice to do next?

* Hopefully, the translation of the fragments will improve through time.
It would be nice to collect all the reactions to each fragment and add
them to their "Issue" thread?
* If translations to languages other than english become available,
tweet those as well?
* Add audio files with community-curated greek pronounciation for each fragment?
* Change the black background for appropriate images?
